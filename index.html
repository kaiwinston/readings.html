<h2>Susan Sontag's On Photography</h2>	
<p1>When it comes to photography, I like images that tell a story-- regardless of aesthetics or visual appeal. I think my first realization of this (and also a great example) was freshman year, listening to Nailbomb’s first and only studio album, Point Blank; the cover exhibiting an elderly female Viet Cong with the muzzle of a U.S M-16 rifle pressed against her head. There’s no editing, intense saturation, or defocusing utilized-- just the image, and a bit of shock value. Very literal photography. That’s how I’d utilize a camera and software if I were to get into the medium. Shamelessly raw, evoking, and truthful-- all that good stuff. Despite that, this isn’t to say I lack a respect for other brackets under this umbrella-- abstract, representational, metaphorical, etc. It may be the journalism major speaking, but I do believe the most efficient way to get a story across via photography has to be literal--not up for interpretation. Think, photography’s separation from art early on through the industrial revolution. 
Still, reading it back, I’m spitballing a topic I know little about, ignorant of its basic principles, lacking even a baseline foundation-- take it with a grain of salt. 
Regardless, to get more personal on the matter, the photos I take through the busted lens of my iPhone 10 tell the story of my world, interpretable for me and only me. Blurred pics of Aaliyah and I in the janitor's closet-- following shots of Hendricks and a lamb chop I took home from dinner service at Freeman’s on the Lower East Side. A family of rats huddled in the corner of my cousin Theodora’s living room in the McKibbon Lofts (East Williamsburg). Most recently, the pizza stain left on my sheets at the foot of my bed after deciding the room was too cold to eat at the table. These would not and do not mean anything to the outsider peering in. They’re special to me and only me. That’s how I use photography-- in such, maybe it’s why I’m also not a photographer.
	When it comes to visually representing the state of the world at this very moment, I’d say it’s impossible to keep it to a single photo, hundreds even-- duh. Images only go so far, but if this were my goal, I’d center in on faces. The tiniest wrinkle, scar, or tattoo can go beautifully far in carrying a narrative. They say a picture’s worth a thousand words-- I don’t know about that, but a portrait’s as close as you’d get to fulfilling it. Most importantly, these up-close shots feel more personal, like you’re face-to-face with the person in frame. It’s very intimate-- invasive even. The first thing that comes to mind for me is the side-by-side comparison head shots picturing soviet soldier Evgeny Stepanovich Kobytev prior to enlisting and following a 4-year imprisonment at a Nazi Germany concentration camp. If you’re yet to see it, I encourage you to look it up-- the difference is haunting. Both portraits tell their own story.</p1>
