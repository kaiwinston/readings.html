<h2>Susan Sontag's On Photography</h2>	
<p1>When it comes to photography, I like images that tell a story-- regardless of aesthetics or visual appeal. I think my first realization of this (and also a great example) was freshman year, listening to Nailbomb’s first and only studio album, Point Blank; the cover exhibiting an elderly female Viet Cong with the muzzle of a U.S M-16 rifle pressed against her head. There’s no editing, intense saturation, or defocusing utilized-- just the image, and a bit of shock value. Very literal photography. That’s how I’d utilize a camera and software if I were to get into the medium. Shamelessly raw, evoking, and truthful-- all that good stuff. Despite that, this isn’t to say I lack a respect for other brackets under this umbrella-- abstract, representational, metaphorical, etc. It may be the journalism major speaking, but I do believe the most efficient way to get a story across via photography has to be literal--not up for interpretation. Think, photography’s separation from art early on through the industrial revolution. 
Still, reading it back, I’m spitballing a topic I know little about, ignorant of its basic principles, lacking even a baseline foundation-- take it with a grain of salt. 
Regardless, to get more personal on the matter, the photos I take through the busted lens of my iPhone 10 tell the story of my world, interpretable for me and only me. Blurred pics of Aaliyah and I in the janitor's closet-- following shots of Hendricks and a lamb chop I took home from dinner service at Freeman’s on the Lower East Side. A family of rats huddled in the corner of my cousin Theodora’s living room in the McKibbon Lofts (East Williamsburg). Most recently, the pizza stain left on my sheets at the foot of my bed after deciding the room was too cold to eat at the table. These would not and do not mean anything to the outsider peering in. They’re special to me and only me. That’s how I use photography-- in such, maybe it’s why I’m also not a photographer.
	When it comes to visually representing the state of the world at this very moment, I’d say it’s impossible to keep it to a single photo, hundreds even-- duh. Images only go so far, but if this were my goal, I’d center in on faces. The tiniest wrinkle, scar, or tattoo can go beautifully far in carrying a narrative. They say a picture’s worth a thousand words-- I don’t know about that, but a portrait’s as close as you’d get to fulfilling it. Most importantly, these up-close shots feel more personal, like you’re face-to-face with the person in frame. It’s very intimate-- invasive even. The first thing that comes to mind for me is the side-by-side comparison head shots picturing soviet soldier Evgeny Stepanovich Kobytev prior to enlisting and following a 4-year imprisonment at a Nazi Germany concentration camp. If you’re yet to see it, I encourage you to look it up-- the difference is haunting. Both portraits tell their own story.</p1>
<h2>Nesrine Malik's On AI</h2>
<p>Nesrine Malik’s AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster' entailed a harsh wake up call (hence the title) on the current state of AI-- predominantly in relation to social media. After a quick read through, I formed a number of ideas and opinions on the various points Malik touched on.
	To start, the article opens in explaining the dangers of AI through the distortion of reality. If artificial intelligence succeeds in deceivement, then essentially, it’s controlling our emotions through the media it continues to produce on notably larger, faster, scales then any human ever could. Speaking from experience, the majority of AI generated media in my feed is almost always noticeably AI; what this means is differentiating between the real and fake for me remains clear-- for now. Despite this, it isn’t to say that in the eyes of an older (or younger) audience, the line blurs. Malik’s point holds.
	From an optimists perspective however, it’s my idea that the general consensus surrounding AI on social media platforms is negative-- especially in the creative field. Perhaps this could be a turning point towards a downward trajectory in social media usage-- or a return to platforms like instagram stepping away from their entertainment oriented focus and back to how it was initially designed to function: a photo social network.
	Following the initial point, the article transitions to AI’s role in the political world-- more specifically, as an extension of propaganda. Malik claims that this extension brings an infinite number of fantasy scenarios despite a lack of involvement with humans in general. I do however believe that this is kind of just the state of AI as a whole--regardless of politics. What the article failed to reflect upon was relating this message back to its primary point;a world run on indistinguishably real AI propaganda to push political agendas. Scary stuff.
	Still, the most terrifying of it all was Prof Roland Meyer’s (media and visual culture scholar) cited take on the matter that structurally, generative AI is conservative by nature. This is due to the model’s training through pre-existing data across the world web which according to researchers is inherently biased toward ethnic diversity. When you put it together, the findings make sense, and although I’d love to see the actual research breaking this down, it points towards a dark future.
	With this in mind, you would think this training material would be filtered through (which I’m sure it is to an extent) but this would probably spark a number of problems. Before going forward, it is important to preface that I still have a very novice-level understanding of artificial intelligence as a whole, though this does just kind of make sense to me-- for one, it’d probably be practically impossible to filter through that much material and then it raises the question of who? Who would do it? What would do it? And who’s to say that they’re ethics or morals are in the right place? These things have been questioned for centuries, only now in the case of computers.
	If this is so, then is there really anything we can do about it (Research AI 2027)? Perhaps the reason we’re faced with such issues is since they were never meant to be in the first place.

<h2>Graphic Novel Analysis</h2>
<p>In Chapter 2 (Heela: My Stolen Future) of Laurence Ivil’s, Alicia Prager’s, and Saidu Bah’s Motherhood in Crisis, illustrations, photographs, and text are all incorporated coincidingly and stand alone throughout the graphic novel in pursuit of a number of purposes. Let’s start first with what pops first: visual appeal. As a whole, the graphic novel is notably aesthetically pleasing. Considering the topic at hand in importance of education on the topic, I have a feeling that the targeted audience could be on the younger side-- specifically a teenage crowd. With this in mind, it’s especially important to hold engagement without sacrificing the subject at hand. This is why the incorporation of these three elements (illustrations, photography, and text) work as harmoniously as they do together-- balancing each other out and whatnot. The illustrations (ecspecially in this comic esque format) grabbed my attention immediately. It keeps the reader entertained and breaks the boundaries that we so often see photography limited by. In the case of this chapter, Heela’s story was never documented via photography or even most likely through the time of occurrence. It was accounted after the fact therfor making it practically impossible to have this element of photography incorporated through these areas without staging various photoshoots (and at that point just make a film). This, I believe, would take away from the overall message and would probably be pretty difficult to actually pull off correctly. With illustrations, we can paint the story visually with further control and abstraction in comparison. There’s notably less confinement, more creative freedom, and more room to get that message through. Still, the addition of photography (in reference to the Rainbo Centre) made the story feel all the more real (since well, it was) and almost worked as a reveal to the audience around this fact. These are real lives at hand, not cartoons, and the addition of real world images were a stark reminder of this fact. Side note, but it was also nice seeing the real emotion on ones face that illustrations can often struggle to depict. It’s very moving. When it comes to the inclusion of text, the authors tastefully incorporated the perfect amount of narrative as not to bombard the audience with large amounts of text but just enough to work with the illustrations and photography to let the point be heard. Arguably being the most important of these three elements, the chapter would make practically no sense without it. Plus, these visual aspects can only go so far without the incorporation of writing into the mix-- at least in regards to a topic of such importance (and considering the target readers). Ultimately, with these three components in working in tandem, the graphic novel comes out very equally balanced as compared to an all text piece or vice versa. They don’t supplement but rather compliment each other-- working together, on top of each other (litterally), and alone at times when need be; specifically in the opening and closing sides which solely consist of text.</p>
